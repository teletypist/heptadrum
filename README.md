# heptadrum

Seven-sided eight-pad synth drum with space for (very shallow) Eurorack sized modules (20HP per side, customizable).

## Features

The Heptadrum is a reasonably portable (and playable) synth drum setup. The drum is arranged as a seven-sided cylinder with 8 pads on the top (one per side plus a center pad). Designed to be played by hand something like a Hang Drum. 20HP around each side is provided for Eurorack-sized synth modules to be included to generate the sound (140HP all up). Each of the pads has trigger outs and the rest is up to the builder.

There is space in the middle to include a 6" Speaker driver so that it can be played with little more than a source of power.
